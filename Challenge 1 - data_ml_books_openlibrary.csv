He lands in the year 802701: the world has been transformed by a society living in apparent harmony and bliss, but as the Traveler stays in the future he discovers a hidden barbaric and depraved subterranean class. Wells's transparent commentary on the capitalist society was an instant bestseller and launched the time-travel genre."

The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package--PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)--that is freely available online""--Back cover."

Lattimore's elegant, fluent verses—with their memorably phrased heroic epithets and remarkable fidelity to the Greek—remain unchanged, but classicist Richard Martin has added a wealth of supplementary materials designed to aid new generations of readers. A new introduction sets the poem in the wider context of Greek life, warfare, society, and poetry, while line-by-line notes at the back of the volume offer explanations of unfamiliar terms, information about the Greek gods and heroes, and literary appreciation. A glossary and maps round out the book.



The result is a volume that actively invites readers into Homer's poem, helping them to understand fully the worlds in which he and his heroes lived—and thus enabling them to marvel, as so many have for centuries, at Hektor and Ajax, Paris and Helen, and the devastating rage of Achilleus."

These topics are traditionally taught in disparate courses, making it hard for data science or computer science students, or professionals, to efficiently learn the mathematics.

This self-contained textbook bridges the gap between mathematical and machine learning texts, introducing the mathematical concepts with a minimum of prerequisites. It uses these concepts to derive four central machine learning methods: linear regression, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixture models, and support vector machines. For students and others with a mathematical background, these derivations provide a starting point to machine learning texts. For those learning the mathematics for the first time, the methods help build intuition and practical experience with applying mathematical concepts.

Machine Learning,Tony Jebara,2004,2,,,"Information storage and retrieval systems, Computer vision, Statistics, Computer science, Artificial intelligence","Machine Learning: Discriminative and Generative covers the main contemporary themes and tools in machine learning ranging from Bayesian probabilistic models to discriminative support-vector machines. However, unlike previous books that only discuss these rather different approaches in isolation, it bridges the two schools of thought together within a common framework, elegantly connecting their various theories and making one common big-picture. Also, this bridge brings forth new hybrid discriminative-generative tools that combine the strengths of both camps. This book serves multiple purposes as well. The framework acts as a scientific breakthrough, fusing the areas of generative and discriminative learning and will be of interest to many researchers. However, as a conceptual breakthrough, this common framework unifies many previously unrelated tools and techniques and makes them understandable to a larger portion of the public. This gives the more practical-minded engineer, student and the industrial public an easy-access and more sensible road map into the world of machine learning. Machine Learning: Discriminative and Generative is designed for an audience composed of researchers & practitioners in industry and academia. The book is also suitable as a secondary text for graduate-level students in computer science and engineering."

Machine learning in computer vision,Nicu Sebe,2005,2,,,"Computer vision, Machine learning, Computer science, Multimedia systems, Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics, User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction, Multimedia Information Systems, Probability and Statistics in Computer Science","It started withimageprocessing inthesixties. Back then, it took ages to digitize a Landsat image and then process it with a mainframe computer. P- cessing was inspired on theachievements of signal processing and was still very much oriented towards programming. In the seventies, image analysis spun off combining image measurement with statistical pattern recognition. Slowly, computational methods detached themselves from the sensor and the goal to become more generally applicable. In theeighties, model-drivencomputervision originated when arti?cial- telligence and geometric modelling came together with image analysis com- nents. The emphasis was on precise analysiswithlittleorno interaction, still very much an art evaluated by visual appeal. The main bottleneck was in the amount of data using an average of 5 to 50 pictures to illustrate the point. At the beginning of the nineties, vision became available to many with the advent of suf?ciently fast PCs. The Internet revealed the interest of the g- eral public im images, eventually introducingcontent-basedimageretrieval. Combining independent (informal) archives, as the web is, urges for inter- tive evaluation of approximate results andhence weak algorithms and their combination in weak classi?ers."
Machine Learning in Medicine,Ton J. M. Cleophas,2013,1,,,"Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics, Biomedicine, Statistics, Statistics, general, Biomedicine general, Entomology, Medicine/Public Health, general, Computer vision, Medicine, Literacy","Machine learning is concerned with the analysis of large data and multiple variables. However, it is also often more sensitive than traditional statistical methods to analyze small data. The first volume reviewed subjects like optimal scaling, neural networks, factor analysis, partial least squares, discriminant analysis, canonical analysis, and fuzzy modeling. This second volume includes various clustering models, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, discrete wavelet analysis, genetic programming, association rule learning, anomaly detection, correspondence analysis, and other subjects. Both the theoretical bases and the step by step analyses are described for the benefit of non-mathematical readers. Each chapter can be studied without the need to consult other chapters. Traditional statistical tests are, sometimes, priors to machine learning methods, and they are also, sometimes, used as contrast tests. To those wishing to obtain more knowledge of them, we recommend to additionally study (1) Statistics Applied to Clinical Studies 5th Edition 2012, (2) SPSS for Starters Part One and Two 2012, and (3) Statistical Analysis of Clinical Data on a Pocket Calculator Part One and Two 2012, written by the same authors, and edited by Springer, New York."
Statistical Machine Learning,Zhihua Zhang,2017,2,,,,"This book will provide a comprehensive description for statistical machine learning. The book will be helpful for readers from both computer science and statistics communities. Specifically, the first part is especially useful for readers from machine learning or data mining, because machine learning is built on probability and statistics and this part can fill their background in statistics and probability. The third part is very useful for readers from mathematics and statistics, because it can bring new research topics or job opportunities for them."

When the crash of the U. S. stock market became public knowledge in the fall of 2008, it was already old news. The real crash, the silent crash, had taken place over the previous year, in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn’t shine, and the SEC doesn’t dare, or bother, to tread: the bond and real estate derivative markets where geeks invent impenetrable securities to profit from the misery of lower- and middle-class Americans who can’t pay their debts. The smart people who understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by hope and fear; in any case, they weren’t talking.

The crucial question is this: Who understood the risk inherent in the assumption of ever-rising real estate prices, a risk compounded daily by the creation of those arcane, artificial securities loosely based on piles of doubtful mortgages? Michael Lewis turns the inquiry on its head to create a fresh, character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor, a fitting sequel to his #1 best-selling *Liar’s Poker*. Who got it right? he asks. Who saw the real estate market for the black hole it would become, and eventually made billions of dollars from that perception? And what qualities of character made those few persist when their peers and colleagues dismissed them as Chicken Littles?

Though created by a handful of mavericks, the fast food industry has triggered the homogenization of our society. Fast food has hastened the malling of our landscape, widened the chasm between rich and poor, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and propelled the juggernaut of American cultural imperialism abroad. That's a lengthy list of charges, but Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of first-rate reportage, wry wit, and careful reasoning.

Schlosser's myth-shattering survey stretches from the California subdivisions where the business was born to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike where many of fast food's flavors are concocted. He hangs out with the teenagers who make the restaurants run and communes with those unlucky enough to hold America's most dangerous job -- meatpacker. He travels to Las Vegas for a giddily surreal franchisers' convention where Mikhail Gorbachev delivers the keynote address. He even ventures to England and Germany to clock the rate at which those countries are becoming fast food nations.

Along the way, Schlosser unearths a trove of fascinating, unsettling truths -- from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production, popular culture, and even real estate. He also uncovers the fast food chains' efforts to reel in the youngest, most susceptible consumers even while they hone their institutionalized exploitation of teenagers and minorities. Schlosser then turns a critical eye toward the hot topic of globalization -- a phenomenon launched by fast food.

FAST FOOD NATION is a groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats."

Selected machine learning reductions,Anna Ewa Choromanska,2014,1,,,,"Machine learning is a field of science aiming to extract knowledge from the data. Optimization lies in the core of machine learning as many learning problems are formulated as optimization problems, where the goal is to minimize/maximize an objective function. More complex machine learning problems are then often solved by reducing them to simpler sub-problems solvable by known optimization techniques. This dissertation addresses two elements of the machine learning system 'pipeline', designing efficient basic optimization tools tailored to solve specific learning problems, or in other words optimize a specific objective function, and creating more elaborate learning tools with sub-blocks being essentially optimization solvers equipped with such basic optimization tools. In the first part of this thesis we focus on a very specific learning problem where the objective function, either convex or non-convex, involves the minimization of the partition function, the normalizer of a distribution, as is the case in conditional random fields (CRFs) or log-linear models.

Our work proposes a tight quadratic bound on the partition function which parameters are easily recovered by a simple algorithm that we propose. The bound gives rise to the family of new optimization learning algorithms, based on bound majorization (we developed batch, both full-rank and low-rank, and semi-stochastic variants), with linear convergence rate that successfully compete with state-of-the-art techniques (among them gradient descent methods, Newton and quasi-Newton methods like L-BFGS, etc.). The only constraint we introduce is on the number of classes which is assumed to be finite and enumerable. The bound majorization method we develop is simultaneously the first reduction scheme discussed in this thesis, where throughout this thesis by 'reduction' we understand the learning approach or algorithmic technique converting a complex machine learning problem into a set of simpler problems (that can be as small as a single problem). Secondly, we focus on developing two more sophisticated machine learning tools, for solving harder learning problems.

The tools that we develop are built from basic optimization sub-blocks tailored to solve simpler optimization sub-problems. We first focus on the multi class classification problem where the number of classes is very large. We reduce this problem to a set of simpler sub-problems that we solve using basic optimization methods performing additive update on the parameter vector. Secondly we address the problem of learning data representation when the data is unlabeled for any classification task. We reduce this problem to a set of simpler sub-problems that we solve using basic optimization methods, however this time the parameter vector is updated multiplicatively. In both problems we assume that the data come in a stream that can even be infinite. We will now provide more specific description of each of these problems and describe our approach for solving them. In the multi class classification problem it is desirable to achieve train and test running times which are logarithmic in the label complexity.

The existing approaches to this problem are either intractable or do not adapt well to the data. We propose a reduction of this problem to a set of binary regression problems organized in a tree structure and introduce a new splitting criterion (objective function) allowing gradient descent style optimization (bound optimization methods can also be used). A decision tree algorithm that we obtain differs from traditional decision trees in the objective optimized, and in how that optimization is done. The different objective has useful properties, such us it guarantees balanced and small-error splits, while the optimization uses an online learning algorithm that is queried and trained simultaneously as we pass over the data. Furthermore, we prove an upper-bound on the number of splits required to reduce the entropy of the tree leafs below small threshold. We empirically show that the trees we obtain have logarithmic depth, which implies logarithmic training and testing running times, and significantly smaller error than random trees.

Finally, we consider the problem of unsupervised (clustering) learning of data representation, where the quality of obtained clustering is measured using a very simple, intuitive and widely cited clustering objective, k-means clustering objective. We introduce a family of online clustering algorithms by extending algorithms for online supervised learning, with access to expert predictors (which are basic sub-blocks of our learning system), to the unsupervised learning setting. The parameter vector corresponds to the probability distribution over the experts. Different update rules for the parameter vector depend on an approximation to the current value of the k-means clustering objective obtained by each expert, and model different levels of non-stationarity in the data. We show that when the experts are batch clustering algorithms with approximation guarantees with respect to the k-means clustering objective, applied to a sliding window of the data stream, our algorithms obtain approximation guarantees with respect to the k-means clustering objective.

Thus simultaneously we address an open problem posed by Dasgupta for approximating k-means clustering objective on data streams. We experimentally show that our algorithms' empirical performance tracks that of the best clustering algorithm in its experts set and that our algorithms outperform widely used online algorithms."
